### An Application of the Primal and Dual Linear Programming

Pennsylvania State University

State College, PA

2018

- Maximize the Benefit of a Company with Limited Machining and Raw Materials.
- Set up a linear programming (LP) in Mathemarica, and wrote a function to repeat the process of choosing pivots by Simplex Algorithm to optimize LP in finitely steps so that solved the optimal solution about the amount of materials.
- Established the dual of Primary LP, obtained the unit price of machining and raw materials when the company got the maximum profit, and compare the unit price to determine whether it was more profitable or not to invest more if additional machining time and raw materials were available (unit price was known).



### The Optimization of Dfs (Depth First Search) Algorithm

Pennsylvania State University

State College, PA

2017

- Applied C programming to optimize DFS by pruning.
- In a minimum problem, reduced the number of Search Treeâ€™s branches according to the estimated lower bound of the current node in order to get the optimal solution or better solution faster.
- Attempted to optimize the time complexity of the algorithm, such as local search and double nested query.
